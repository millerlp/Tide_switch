# in t_tide_v1.3beta.zip

# read_harmonicsfile is a function to parse a tidal harmonics file taken from 
# the XTide program. 

# The harmonic file must be a text format, not the binary 
# tcd format that is generally distributed with XTide. To generate this text 
# version of the harmonics.tcd file, you must use the command line tool 
# restore_tide_db found in the tcd-utils package distributed on the XTide site.
# See http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html for downloads.
